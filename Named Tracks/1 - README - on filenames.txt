Not every file in this folder has their track number listed in parentheses. 

This is happening because I, Salora Rainriver, was a bit lazy.
If you wanna check out these files and rename them to include the track number, go ahead and be my guest. 

I don't know if multiple tracks can be fed into the same MIDI channel (or if that only exists for channel 10), but if you encounter such a situation, please count all those tracks as the same track for the purposes of counting, 

you know, because the entire point of listing that out is to tell people how complicated the song is going to be to play with their 2-3 instrument setup or their small band of people. and you can only enable/disable channels, not tracks.
