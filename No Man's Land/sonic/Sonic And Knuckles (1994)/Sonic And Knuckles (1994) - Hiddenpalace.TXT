File Type: MIDI
Game System: Sega Genesis
Game Name: Sonic and Knuckles
Song Title: Hidden Palace Zone (Remix)
Sequenced by: Jarel Jones <ArrowFox@mailandnews.com>
Other Information: This is a remix, but it's completely recognizable if you've played Hidden Palace from Sonic and Knuckles.  It changes the theme around by turning the background into a nice stereo sound and adding to the main theme that's already there, but everything from the original hasn't been changed.
