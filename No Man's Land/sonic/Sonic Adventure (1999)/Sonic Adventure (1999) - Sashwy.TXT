Game Name: Sonic Adventure
Song Title: Speed Highway
Sequenced by: Merit Celaire <mcelaire@freent.com>
Other Information: I'm not really a rock music fan, but the music forthe "Sonic Adventure" game for the Sega Dreamcast isa huge and clear exception (No, I don't have the "SonicAdventure" game yet, but I hope to soon when I purchasemy Sega Dreamcast hopefully next year). Thus, I have arranged the "Sonic Adventure" music which is heard in the"Speed Highway" stage. In deeper detail: this is heard when you're running through the Speed Highwayitself (for Sonic, it's Section 1 of this stage; forTails, it's when he races against Dr. Robotnik in thisstage). I hope that you love listening to this tune as much as I loved arranging it! Expect a few more "SonicAdventure" MIDIs from me soon!
