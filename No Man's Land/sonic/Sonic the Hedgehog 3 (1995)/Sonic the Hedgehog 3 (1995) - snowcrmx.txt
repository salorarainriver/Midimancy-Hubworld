Other Information: This is one of my best works yet.  Now that I'vediscovered the new, undocumented, features andeffects of midi I can perform better sweepsand newer effects such as record scratching andmetal ricochets.  This song requires a goodsound card (Wingroove/Sound Blaster AWE32 orBetter).  Enjoy!
