Song Title: Credits (2)
Sequenced by: Jarel Jones <arrowhh@geocities.com>
Other Information: This song is the original version of another song in your New Files section, the Credits (XG Enhaanced) by JD Harding.  I believe he took my midi and improved on it.  If you don't believe me, you can check his own website since I submit all my Sonic midis there.  My version is in his Sonic 3 for Genesis section, and soon after, he put his own version in his personal section.
