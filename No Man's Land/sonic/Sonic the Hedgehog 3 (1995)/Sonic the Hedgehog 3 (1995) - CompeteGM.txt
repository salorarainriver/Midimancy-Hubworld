File Type: MIDI
Game System: Sega Genesis
Game Name: Sonic the Hedgehog 3
Song Title: Compete (Remix)
Sequenced by: Jarel Jones <ArrowFox@mailandnews.com>
Other Information: This is a remix of the Compete song played on the 2-Player menu.  it does contain quite a bit of differences, but like most of my remixes, it contains enough of the original to make it easily recognizable.  This midi is the GM version and sounds best with Sound Blaster cards (Wingroove included).
