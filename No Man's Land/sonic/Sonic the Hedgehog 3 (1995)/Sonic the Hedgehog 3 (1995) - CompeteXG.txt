File Type: MIDI
Game System: Sega Genesis
Game Name: Sonic the Hedgehog 3
Song Title: Compete (Remix) (XG Version)
Sequenced by: Jarel Jones <ArrowFox@mailandnews.com>
Other Information: This is a remix of the Compete song played on the 2-Player menu.  it does contain quite a bit of differences, but like most of my remixes, it contains enough of the original to make it easily recognizable.  This midi is the XG version and sounds best with XG cards, such as the Yamaha Soft Synthesizer (S-YXG100).  It does not contain XG effects (such as flanging); it simply uses instrument combos that sound better with these type of cards.
