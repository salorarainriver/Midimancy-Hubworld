hey
i love this song--one of my favorites in Sonic CD besides the Stardust Speedway trio and Wacky Workbench Bad Future (all the US version of course... i'm not privelaged enough to own the Japanese one)  
but i thought this version was a bit more accurate to the CD track than the original... lemme know if you agree or disagree ^_^
