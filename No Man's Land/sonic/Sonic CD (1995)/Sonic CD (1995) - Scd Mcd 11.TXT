Other Information: 
Just so you'll know if you didn't already, this is *not* a remix of a song from Sonic CD.  The "G" mix part of the title just means that this is the version of the song from the "Good Future" version of Collision Chaos Zone.  That's how it's titled in the sound test menu.  Just though I should let ya know.
