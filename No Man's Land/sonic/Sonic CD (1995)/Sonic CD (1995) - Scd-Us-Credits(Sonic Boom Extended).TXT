Words to Song:

If you're strong you can fly

You can reach the other side of the rainbow

It's all right, take a chance, 'cause there is no circumstance

That you can't handle (when you use your mind)

Mr. Bad's got it good

But this aint' his neighborhood

He's takin' over... no, no

Time is now, he can't hide

Find the power deep inside and make it happen

Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom

Trouble keeps you runnin' faster, Sonic Boom

Save the planet from disaster, Sonic Boom

Spinning through a world in motion, Sonic Boom

Take it all the way

Make your move, break it out

That's what life is all about

It's your adventure from the dark to the light

On a supersonic flight, gotta keep it going

Sonic Boom, Sonic Boom

Trouble Keeps you runnin' faster, Sonic Boom

Save the planet from disaster, Sonic Boom

Spinning through a world in motion, Sonic Boom

Take it all the way
