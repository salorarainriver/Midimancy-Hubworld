WOO HOOO

my favorite Past song from Sonic CD.... man i suck at writing these.  :-(  i tried to use the instruments i could to get the same sound as the actual game, but the first 2 bars are just impossible, i'm sorry.  i think i did a pretty good job with most of it.  i probably missed the bassline in a few places, probably screwed up some chords in others, but that's all normal.  what i'm hoping is that one of the pro's out there can look at this and at least get a head start on making a killer version of this... i love Collision Chaos ^_^
