This is an updated version of my original sequence of this song.  My original MIDI is already in the Sega Genesis archive under the filename "s2-chemical.mid" which was uploaded by someone else (without asking me first!).  Anyway, it's also titled "Chemical Plant Zone (8)" where this MIDI is listed in the archive.
