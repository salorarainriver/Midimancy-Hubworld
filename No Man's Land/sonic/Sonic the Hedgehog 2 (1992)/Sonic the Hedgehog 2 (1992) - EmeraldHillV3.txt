Other Information: I've added the one thing to this midi that I couldn't include in it before; vibrato.  Now that NoteWorthy Composer allows for use of the Modulation Wheel controller (or at least, their new beta does), I can start using vibrato and the such in my midis.  Woohoo!Now, if only they'd let you use the Registered Parameter Numbers (controllers 100 and 101) I'd be extremely happy.
