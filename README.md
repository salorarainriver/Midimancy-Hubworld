# Midimancy-Hubworld
A space to store MIDI files customized for use with Impstation, alongside guides on how to most effectively use MIDI files on Impstation (and other SS14 servers)

## Disclaimers:
I <sub>Salora Rainriver</sub> am not a person with any formal training in music theory, and I am not a musician. Everything I know about MIDI files and music has been completely self-taught. 

Furthermore, a note on crediting: I <sub>Salora Rainriver</sub> do not make the midis posted here from scratch. They are found from varying places all over the internet, often without proper attribution. Furthermore, it is an uncommon practice for some MIDI creators to put their credits in the channel names of the files. Since I need to edit these channel names to something more descriptive and usable ingame, these attributions will be unavoidably deleted. For this reason, the entire repository falls under the [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license](LICENSE), as we cannot in good conscience copyright literally any part of this project. ***It's free forever.***

# What is Midimancy?
[A funny name I made up to describe the knowledgable use of MIDI files within ss14, primarily the use of multiple instruments and selective channel-playing in order to enhance the playing and listening experience.](How-To-Midimancy.txt) 

# how to use the Repository
This repository is a work in progress, but there IS an attempt to sort it. here's the system. 

## Filenames
the system goes, 
        **Artist - Song (number of tracks, or "/X/-mix")**
The 'number of tracks' section may be omitted, depending on if I felt like bothering. 

Be aware of **Piano Mix** - that means the file is clearly intended to be played on a "single piano". Many are unedited. Don't split channels for these, it won't end well.

**"Artist" will default to whatever name is the most recognizable** - EG; while anime openings are often written and performed by commercial musicians, people may recognize 'Beastars' before they recognize 'Yoasobi' (even though Yoasobi is fucking awesome)

**'Artist' name will often be abbreviated**, just to make it easier to read the file name in a pinch. You'll find readmes in the folders explaining the abbreviations when needed.

**All files in the repository** (save for piano mixes) **have descriptive track names** that I have verified are visible ingame. Some descriptions were not written by me. The funny ones were probably written by me.

**Because of the sheer number of files in or about to enter the repository, I've included several folders featuring broad 'categories' of music.** these titles correlate to the 'artist' when such is a videogame (because I have so much videogame soundtrack), and there are also a few special folders that are not as self-explanatory...

## Special Folders
(Note that "popularized by" is going to be subjective. I am trying my best, and don't yell at me for putting the finnish folk song Llevan Polka in 'Vocaloid')

**Pop Music** - it's not a soundtrack, it's not a meme, it's not a folk song, it's not a musical number, it's an honest to goodness commercial song that was written by a professional musician for the primary intent of it being recorded onto an album, performed at a concert, played on the radio or during social events, or streamed on some online streaming platform. I am not here to judge what objectively makes a song "pop", I am here to make sure people don't have to scroll through nintendo games to find classic rock's greatest hits, and vice versa.

**Vocaloid and Similar** - the songs were either originally sung by a vocaloid, or they were popularized by a vocaloid cover. 'Similar' is so I can accommodate for synth voicebanks that aren't, strictly speaking, vocaloids.
(if Sad Machine is in 'pop music' and not 'vocaloid', you *have* to yell at me about it until it's fixed)

**Movies or Shows** - the songs either are part of a movie or show's soundtrack, or were popularized by a movie or show. Just being a pop song that got famously or infamously put into a movie is not enough to consider it 'popularized' by the movie. 
(I have no idea where I'm gonna put Ocean Man...)

**Folk Songs and Classical** - this is for the songs that are so old, they might not even HAVE an artist! If you're wondering what my cutoff point for 'this song's old as balls' is, It's somewhere between the Jazz Age and the end of WWII. Hopefully I never find a midi of a song composed and/or recorded on the exact year the war ended.

**Musicals** - musical numbers from *stageplays.* I cannot stress this enough, this category is for *stageplays,* not Disney! 
Not currently present, but when I find the midis for Heathers or Les Mis, I'm making this folder.

**Memes** - I am going to be as restrictive as fuck for this due to the nature of memes - when a song was either created explicitly to be an online gag, *or* the meme popularized it *so much* that it would have vanished *almost entirely* into obscurity without the meme, 
that is when the song belongs here. 
    for example: 
    - Gangam Style was popular without its meme status. Actually it became a meme *because* it was popular. Many such songs are like this, so before you ask where the fuck the dancing toothless song is, *have you checked-*
    - What's Up by 4 Non Blondes is a one-hit wonder that only became such because someone made a sped-up remix of it for a He-man video. It's a meme song.
    - Neil Ciceriega may be an internet personality responsible for many internet memes, but his work as Lemon Demon are actual serious works of music, not memes. 
        - Mouth Moods, on the other hand... 
Also, if it's not meant to be humorous I can't count it as a meme. I'm sorry to the fans of multi-animator projects out there, but this repository is for people trying to play music during Spation, and they probably want something silly if they're clicking on the folder titled "Memes". 

**Holiday** - song is associated with a specific holiday. This overrides literally all of the above categories because of how extremely recognizable as a 'holiday song' basically every single holiday song is. Like, if someone's playing Monster Mash, you don't think "hey there's a cute song from the 60s", 
*no no no!* 
You think, "it's spooky season!!!"

**Circus** -  song is associated with the circus. This overrides everything else for the same reason 'holiday' does, and also because this is spation, where you can literally PLAY AS A CLOWN.

**Sal's Edits** - these files were altered by yours truly to have simplified tracks or whatnot, for easier playing. These will usually have names with stuff like "3-track mix" for further clarity.
"vocal mix" is edited to all be on one track, no harmonies. It'll sound funny, but it's meant to be ~immersive~
