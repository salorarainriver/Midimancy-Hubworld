# Midimancy-Hubworld
A space to store MIDI files customized for use with Impstation, alongside guides on how to most effectively use MIDI files on Impstation (and other SS14 servers)

## Disclaimers:
I <sub>Salora Rainriver</sub> am not a person with any formal training in music theory, or any knowledge whatsoever on how to play any instrument that isn't Beginner Piano. Everything I know about MIDI files and music has been completely self-taught. 

Furthermore, a note on crediting: I <sub>Salora Rainriver</sub> do not make the midis posted here from scratch. They are found from varying places all over the internet, often without proper attribution. Furthermore, it is an uncommon practice for some MIDI creators to put their credits in the custom channel names of the files. Since I need to edit these channel names to something more descriptive and usable ingame, these attributions will be unavoidably deleted. For this reason, the entire repository falls under the [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license](LICENSE), as we cannot in good conscience copyright literally any part of this project. ***It's free forever.***

# What is Midimancy?
[A funny name I made up to describe the knowledgable use of MIDI files within ss14, primarily the use of multiple instruments and selective channel-playing in order to enhance the playing and listening experience.](How-To-Midimancy.txt) 

# how to use the Repository
This repository is a work in progress, but there IS an attempt to sort it. The folders operate as follows: 

**Named Tracks** - the tracks have descriptive names that are visible ingame

**Sal's Edits** - these files were altered by yours truly to have simplified tracks or whatnot, for easier playing. These will usually have names with stuff like "3-track mix" for further clarity.

**Vocal Mixes** - one track, no harmonies. sound funny but are meant to be ~immersive~

**Piano Mixes** - the file has multiple tracks, but it's clearly intended to be played on a "single piano". Many are unedited. Don't split channels for these, it won't end well.

There is a naming standard for the midi file names, as well, and it goes like this: 

**Artist - Song (number of tracks, or "/X/-mix")**

'Artist' name will often be abbreviated, just to make it easier to read the file name in a pinch. [more info here](Artist-Abbreviations)
