These abbreviations are not particularly fancy, but we all know there's like 100 ways to read something like 'AC', so...

AA = Ace Attorney
AC = Animal Crossing
DCFC = Death Cab for Cutie
DKC2 = Donkey Kong Country 2
DR = Deltarune
FF = Final Fantasy
HS = Homest- [USER STEPPED ON A LANDMINE]
KH = Kingdom Hearts
P3 = Persona 3
P5 = Persona 5
PKMN = Pokemon (BW is Black/White, FRLG is Fire Red/Leaf Green, HGSS is Heart Gold/Soul Silver, RSE is Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald, you get the idea)
PMD = Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
PvZ = Plants vs Zombies
Splat = Splatoon
UT = Undertale

this list is not complete and will continue to evolve as more songs are added
