If a song here doesn't appear to have an artist, that's ONLY because I don't know the artist. 

or it's llevan polka, which is a folk song that was popularized by a Hatsune Miku cover

ALSO sometimes I say which voicebank sang the song instead of which artist made the song? That's on a basis of recognizability. 
   - I won't be doing that when the vocaloid song was a cover, out of respect for the original artist

so before you ask, YES 'Birdbrain' is in fact the one sung by Kasane Teto and YES that song was a cover.
